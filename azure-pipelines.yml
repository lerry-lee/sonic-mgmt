# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

# For every job:
# continueOnError: false means it's a required test job and will block merge if it fails
# continueOnError: true means it's an optional test job and will not block merge even though it fails(unless a required test job depends on its result)
